# hebrew-special-numbers

## Purpose
This project is a repository of [Hebrew numeral][Hebrew numerals] respellings, designed for use in other libraries. `hebrew-special-numbers` has three goals:

* Platform-independence
* Ease-of-use
* Freedom

## Background
In making programs that produce [Hebrew numerals][], most numbers follow a set pattern of combining letters in order from largest to smallest until the proper [gematria][] sum is produced.

However, many such letter combinations produce words that are customarily avoided. On one side of the spectrum, since it is forbidden to take the Divine Name in vain, combinations otherwise spelling out Divine Names, like for 15 and 16, are spelled as 9+6 or 9+7, rather than as 10+5 and 10+6. On the opposite end of the spectrum, 270 would normally spell "evil" and 278 would spell "murder." Other examples exist. The solution for such words is to reorder the letters to avoid the undesired word.
